• Employed Excel and STATA to clean, combine and analyse the betting odds data of 13 bookmakers for the 2000/01 to the 2021/22 English Premier League (EPL) football seasons 

• Ran 312 multiple regression equations by applying 2 models testing measures of strong and weak forecast efficiency

 • Using the results of the regression analysis I assessed the individual efficiency of the bookmakers and the efficiency of the bookmakers considering the corresponding predictions of the 12 other bookmakers over the 22 seasons

• My main finding was that there was a degree of forecast inefficiency in the predictions made by the bookmakers for all 3 match outcomes (home wins, away wins and draws) over the 22 seasons. This was due to information unaccounted for by one group of bookmakers compared to another group of bookmakers observed
