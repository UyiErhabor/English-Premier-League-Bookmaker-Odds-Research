• Employed Excel and STATA to clean, combine and analyse the betting odds data of 13 bookmakers for the 2000/01 to the 2021/22 English Premier League (EPL) football seasons 

• Applied 312 multiple regression equations using 2 models testing measures of strong and weak forecast efficiency

 • Using the results of the regression analysis, I assessed the individual forecast efficiency of the bookmakers and the forecast efficiency of each bookmaker whilst considering the corresponding predictions of the 12 other bookmakers over the 22 seasons

• My main finding was that there was a degree of forecast inefficiency in the predictions made by the bookmakers for all 3 match outcomes (home wins, away wins and draws) over the 22 seasons. This was due to a consistent lack of  information used to inform predictions demonstrated by one cohort of bookmakers compared to another cohort of bookmakers, leading to forecast inefficiency across the 22 year period analysed. This is a key finding revealed by the comprehensive multiple regression analysis I conducted. Ultimately this research implies that there are opportunities to generate a positive return on investment (ROI) in football betting markets.
